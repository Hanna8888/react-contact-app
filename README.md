<p><b>react-contact-app</b>

- A very simple application to add and remove contacts [see for yourself](https://hanna8888.github.io/react-contact-app/).
- It was built with React Bootstrap 
- The code is well structured and easy to modify

I've used the following resources as listed. These are some awesome creation and I am really thankful to the respective community:
